## Newcomers

So you've heard about Databayt and you're curious. Maybe someone invited you to contribute, or you stumbled across our project and want to understand what we're all about. Either way, **welcome!**

This page is specifically for you - the newcomer who has questions, concerns, and wants to understand how this all works before diving in.

### About Databayt

Databayt is a collaborative open-source project focused on building high-quality, reusable UI components and templates. Our mission is to create a sustainable ecosystem where developers can earn while contributing to excellent UI components.

#### Core Values
- Open Source First - We believe in transparent, community-driven development
- Quality Over Quantity - Every component meets high standards
- Fair Revenue Sharing - Contributors earn from their work
- Community-Driven - Your voice matters in our decisions
- Continuous Learning - We grow together

### Remote Work

**Yes, 100% remote.** There's no office, no required meetings, no fixed hours. Contributors work from their home offices in different countries, coffee shops while traveling, co-working spaces, or wherever they're most productive.

You collaborate through GitHub, communicate async, and work on your own schedule.

### Revenue Sharing

We use a transparent revenue-sharing model where contributors earn a percentage of revenue generated from components they build. Payments are made monthly via bank transfer, PayPal, or crypto.

Most contributors earn $200-800/month after 6 months of consistent contribution. Top contributors earn $2000+/month.

**Timeline Example:**
- Month 1: Build your first component, learn the system
- Month 2-3: Component gets integrated into client projects
- Month 4: Receive your first payment (usually $50-200)
- Month 6+: Multiple components earning, income becomes more substantial

#### Current Metrics
- 1000+ GitHub stars
- 100+ monthly active contributors
- 50+ enterprise clients using our components
- 200+ components in production

### Part-Time Contribution

Perfect for part-time contributors. Most of our successful contributors:
- Work 5-10 hours per week
- Contribute during evenings or weekends

- Have no pressure or deadlines

Many successful contributors started with just 2-3 hours per week.

### Experience Requirements

Everyone starts somewhere. What matters most:

We provide mentorship and have "good first issue" labels specifically for newcomers.
